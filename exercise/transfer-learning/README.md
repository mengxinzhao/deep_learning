Udacity transfer learning work for tensor flow.
This is a really good exercise for using tensor flow.
What I learnt and the codes good for future coding:
1. tensor flow pipeline for training and testing and prediction
2. python generator  trick for getting stratified batches.
3. how to process  data
4. The tensor flow implementation for VGG16/VGG19 (Udacity also pulled from  from github )
5. how to use transfer learning by running the graph up to the last layer of VGG16 and train the customized layer only
